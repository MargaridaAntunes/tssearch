==================
Lockstep Distances
==================

Distance measures that compare the :math:`i`-th point of one time series to the :math:`i`-th point of another are named as lock-step measures (e.g., Euclidean distance and the other Lp norms).
A linear interpolation is computed to the longer series to ensure it has the same length as the shorter series.
